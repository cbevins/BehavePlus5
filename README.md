# BehavePlus5
BehavePlus 5.0.

This is the Git Repository for the BehavePlus Fire Behavior Modeling System,
Version 5.0.5 (Build 307, Aug 8, 2011).

The purpose of this repository is to provide public access to the BehavePlus
source tree, including all C++, image, xml, and resource files.

This repository is NOT intended to be forked or used to create alternate versions,
or even to re-create BehavePlus 5.0.5 itself. The main reason for this is because
BehavePlus 5.0.5 uses Qt3 meta-compiler and shared libraries, which are now out of
date and may be hard to locate.

BehavePlus 5.0.5 was compiled using MS Visual Studio 2008 and Qt3. It requires the
Qt libraries with version number 3.3.8. These libraries are included in the Wise
installation package and are automatically installed on the user's computer during
installation. They are NOT included in this repository.

Because BehavePlus 5.0.5 uses the Qt libraries, it also uses the Qt moc 'meta-compiler'.
While the moc meta-compiler IS NOT included in this repository, all the header files
generated by the moc compiler ARE included in this repository, so you should not need
to use the moc compiler.
